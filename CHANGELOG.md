# ttm v1.4.1 (2021-11-26)

### Misc :zzz:

* added human-readable changelog
* rewrite the README
* re-configure goreleaser to exclude archives and checksums (generated by gitlab anyway)
* updated Makefile to pass `GOFLAGS` and set the value only if nothing is set in env
* added version information to the help message
* change released package name to `time-to-matrix` to avoid name clashes (project and binary name did not change)

> **NOTE** the package name change isn't marked as breaking change because this project is not present in any package repository at the moment of that release.
